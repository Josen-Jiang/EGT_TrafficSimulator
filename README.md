# EGT_TrafficSimulator
Evolutionary game theory used in a traffic simulator, in order to proof the evolution of different pool of norms.


To execute the traffic simulator with the evolutionary approach you should first download the repast symphony from the next directory (available on January 2014):

http://sourceforge.net/projects/repast/files/Repast%20Simphony/Repast%20Simphony%201.2.0/

Once you have downloaded you should open the repast that is inside it and import our project to the workspace.

When this is done you should be able to run the program, if you can run it the runnable of the program is also located in Launchers folder. 
So, by clicking in the TrafficSim.launch launcher and clicking on run as would be enough.

If you have any problem to follow this steps donâ€™t doubt in contact:
